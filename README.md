## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Daniel Sanches, I studied at COTUCA as a Systems Development student, I am currently at METROCAMP studying Computer Engineering. I am currently interning at RAG Sistemas as a back-end programmer and customer support. I like backend, game development and I'm currently studying it again. I've stopped updating my GitHub for a while now so I'm getting back to using it for my personal development projects.
